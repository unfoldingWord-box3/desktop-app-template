# Synopsis:
#   makeAllInstallsElectronite.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script automates the build process for Liminal application on macOS,
#   creating installation packages for both Intel (x64) and ARM64 architectures.
#   It downloads the required Electron and Liminal releases, and processes them
#   into installable packages.
#
# Parameters:
#   None - All URLs and architectures are hardcoded in the script
#
# Return Values:
#   0 - Success, all architectures built successfully
#   1 - Error occurred during download or build process
#

# This script uses the APP_NAME environment variables as defined in app_config.env
source ../../app_config.env

# Confirm the APP_NAME environment variables is set
if [ -z "$APP_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Error: APP_NAME environment variable is not set."
    exit 1

# Replace spaces with a dash (-) in filename
