.SYNOPSIS
    Extracts version number from a filename and sets it as APP_VERSION environment variable.

.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script is part of the Liminal Windows installation process.
    It extracts a version number from an input filename using regex pattern matching
    and sets it as an environment variable. The version number must be in the format
    'vX.Y.Z' where X, Y, and Z are numeric values. This script is used by the Inno
    Setup installer to determine the application version during the build process.

.PARAMETER filename
    The input filename containing a version string in the format 'vX.Y.Z'.
    Example: 'setup_v1.2.3.exe' will extract '1.2.3'.
