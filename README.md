## Setup

1. Scripts will be expecting a repo name of: desktop-app-[app-name] 
Recommended directory structure:

<ul><pre>
|-- repos
    |-- pankosmia
        |-- desktop-app-[app-name]
</pre></ul>

2. Replace all instances of "-template" in packages.json with "-your-app-name". And consider replacing "[app-name]" with "your-app-name" in this README, edit out the first line of 1., remove 2. and 4., renumber, and edit the # desktop-app-template intro.
3. At the root of your fork of this repo, run

<ul><pre>
npm install
</pre></ul>

4. Edit app_config.env, entering the App Name, version number, theme, assets (might not change), and clients.  And replace globalBuildResources/favicon.ico with a customized icon.
5. `cd [os]/scripts`
6. Run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `clone` script to clone all repos listed in `app_config.env` (assets and clients)
7. Run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `app_setup` script to generate the config files to match `app_config.env`. Re-run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `app_setup` script anytime `app_config.env` is modified.
8. Run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `build_clients` script to build all clients. Be patient. This will take a while.
   - This script is intended for setting all clients up for <b>first use</b>, or for rebuilding <b>all</b> clients to their <b>latest main</b> branch. It changes to the main<sup><b>(2)</b></sup> branch, pulls the latest, and builds (or rebuilds) every client every time it is run.<br />
   - Build client manually when you want to use a branch or when you only need to rebuild one client or when you do not want all clients built from their latest main branch!
9. Run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `build_server` script to build the Pankosmia server and assemble the build environment. (be patient. This will also take a while.)

## Use

 - Run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `run` script to start the server without a browser launch.
    - Consider also if you need to delete ~/pankosmia_working first.
   - You'll want to restart the server if deleting ~/pankosmia_working after starting the server. To restart, exit the terminal window where the server is running the run the `run` script<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> again.
   - Only one instance of the server can be running at a time.<sup><b>(3)</b></sup>
 - Client development: Manually build the client(s) changed, stop the server it is is running, then start the server (`run`).  The `run` script will re-assemble the environment to include your build.
 - To generate a release package for the OS you are using, edit the version number for the release in `app_config.env` then run<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> the `bundle_...` script.

## Maintenance:
 - To update, change the [latest version](https://docs.rs/pankosmia_web/latest/pankosmia_web/) of panksomia-web in `/local_server/Cargo.toml` and re-run the `build_server` script.

## Setup, Use, and Maintenance Footnotes
<sup><b>(1)</b></sup> Windows developers, run <b>.bat</b> scripts from a <b>Powershell or Command terminal</b>:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos\pankosmia\desktop-app-[app-name]\windows\scripts>_ `.\[scriptname].bat`<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a **powershell** terminal for the **.ps1** build scripts.

MacOS developers, run .bsh scripts from a **linux terminal**:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos/pankosmia/desktop-app-[app-name]/linux/scripts>_ `./[scriptname].bsh`

Linux developers, run .zsh scripts from a **MacOS terminal**:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos/pankosmia/desktop-app-[app-name]/macos/scripts>_ `./[scriptname].zsh`

<br />
<sup><b>(2)</b></sup> The build script will fail on any clients set to a different branch with uncommitted changes or with conflicts vs, the latest main pull. Scroll back up in the terminal to find any build errors and address them.

<br />
<sup><b>(3)</b></sup> If running into an error saying that another instance is running, you can either find the other instance and stop it, or simply reboot. Another instance could be one started from a .zip, .tgz, installed version, a different desktop-app-[app-name], or a manually started panksomia-web.

## Additional Info TL;DR - For reference when needed!
### Ecosystem setup and configuration
This repo pulls together several libraries and projects into a single app. The projects are spread across several repos to allow modular reuse. Scripts follow for assisting in setup, though it can also all be setup manually. The following assume [the repos](https://github.com/pankosmia/repositories) are installed with the following directory structure.

This is an example. Clients in use may vary. Configuration is handled via `app_config.env`and the `app_setup` script. If you prefer to set this up manually, then see the configuration section under Scripts, towards the bottom of this readme.

```
|-- repos
    |-- pankosmia
        |-- core-client-content repository
        |-- core-client-dashboard repository
        |-- core-client-i18n-editor repository
        |-- core-client-remote-repos repository
        |-- core-client-settings repository
        |-- core-client-workspace repository
        |-- desktop-app-[app-name]
        |-- resource-core
        |-- webfonts-core
```

### Installing the clients
The local_server (pankosmia_web) serves compiled files from the `build` directory of each client, each client must be built. 

This is handled by the `clone` and `build_clients` scripts, though can also all be run manually which is helpful during development.
```
# In each client repo, NOT this repo!
npm install
npm run build
```
Running `run`, `build_server`, or `bundle_...` all copy the latest build to the build environment.

### Scripts

#### Configuration

Config files must match clients and assets utilized. Scripts that write them are provided, or you can adjust them manually. The configuration files are:

| Linux | Windows | MacOS |
|-------|---------|-------|
| <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />/globalBuildResources/theme.json<br />/linux/buildResources/setup/app_setup.json</pre> | <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />/globalBuildResources/theme.json<br />/windows/buildResources/setup/app_setup.json</pre> | <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />/globalBuildResources/theme.json<br />/macos/buildResources/setup/app_setup.json</pre> 

To setup config files using one of the scripts that follow, first update `app_config.env`.

##### Config scripts:

| Description | Linux | Windows | MacOS |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------|

| For each asset repo in `/app_config.env`: git checkout main, git pull<br />For each client repo in  `/app_config.env`: `git checkout main`, `git pull`, `npm install`, and `npm run build`.<br />***Dev's should build manually when testing branch(es).*** | /linux/scripts/build_clients.bsh | /windows/scripts/build_clients.bat | /macos/scripts/build_clients.zsh |
