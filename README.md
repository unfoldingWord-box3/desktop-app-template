# desktop-app-template
This template is designed to be forked for Desktop App repos built on Pankosmia.

Choose a repo-name of 30 characters or less to prevent **Windows developers** from needing to clone to a shorter local repo name. The windows cargo build c compiler requires repos names of 30 characters or less.

## Setup

1. Recommended directory structure:

<ul><pre>
|-- repos
    |-- pankosmia
        |-- [your-desktop-app-repo-name] <b><em>(30 characters or less on windows!)</em></b>
</pre></ul>

2. Replace all instances of "desktop-app-template" in packages.json with "[your-desktop-app-repo-name]" and update the name and description, and in the second paragraph of Additional Info, remove "This is an example. Clients in use may vary."
3. At the root of your clone of this repo, run

<ul><pre>
npm install
</pre></ul>

4. Edit app_config.env, entering the App Name, version number, theme, assets (might not change), and clients.
5. Change /globalBuildResources/theme.json directly to customize your app. And for logos, see the [Branding README](/branding/README.md) for scripts for customizing /globalBuildResources/*.ico, /globalBuildResources/*.png, and /globalBuildResources/icon.icns, along with info on how each is used.
6. `cd [os]/scripts`
7. Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `clone` script to clone all repos listed in `app_config.env` (assets and clients)
8. Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `app_setup` script to generate the config files to match `app_config.env`. Re-run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `app_setup` script anytime `app_config.env` is modified.
9. Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `build_clients` script to build all clients. Be patient. This will take a while.
   - This script is intended for setting all clients up for <b>first use</b>, or for rebuilding <b>all</b> clients to their <b>latest main</b> branch. It changes to the main<sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> branch, pulls the latest, and builds (or rebuilds) every client every time it is run.<br />
   - Build client manually when you want to use a branch or when you only need to rebuild one client or when you do not want all clients built from their latest main branch!
10. Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `build_server` script to build the Pankosmia server and assemble the build environment. (be patient. This will also take a while.)
11. Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `build_viewer` script to create an Electronite viewer for use with the local dev build environment.  The output will be in `[os]/viewer/project/payload`
12. Plan at some point to customize this readme for your project.  At minimum:
    - rewrite the top most "# desktop-app-template" section
    - replace all instances of "[your-desktop-app-repo-name]" with your desktop app repo name"
    - delete 2. and 12., and re-number.

## Use

 - Run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `run` script to start the server without a browser launch.
    - Consider also if you need to delete ~/pankosmia_working first.
   - You'll want to restart the server if deleting ~/pankosmia_working after starting the server. To restart, exit the terminal window where the server is running the run the `run` script<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> again.
   - Only one instance of the server can be running at a time.<sup id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>
 - Client development:
   - Manually build the client(s) changed, stop the server it is is running, then start the server (`run`).  The `run` script will re-assemble the environment to include your build.
   - Run the `viewer` script to use the Electronite viewer with the local dev build environment.   The output will be in `[os]/viewer/project/payload` 
 - To generate a release package for the OS you are using, edit the version number for the release in `app_config.env` then run<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> the `bundle_...` script.
 - To generate artifacts:
   1. [Manually run the desired workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow) (Actions > [select workflow] > Run workflow).
      - The current main branch of client repo and resource at the time of running the workflow will be used.
   2. Download resulting artifacts (Actions > click the name of a run to see the workflow run summary > scroll down to the bottom to the Artifacts section > to download, click either the name of each artifact or the down arrow on each row
   3. Any double-compressed artifacts should have one layer uncompressed before release, e.g.:
      - Strip *.tgz.zip down to *.tgz
      - Strip *.zip.zip down to *.zip
      - If working from windows, avoid releasing a re-zipping a macos or linux zip package if a .pkg, .sh, .bsh, .zsh was in the layer re-zipped in windows. Doing so would otherwise remove file permission settings of `chmod +x` where they are needed.
      - Release the *.pkg.zip layer as .zip as it includes a README file in the same layer as the pkg, which contains installation and upgrade instructions / info.
   4. Upload releases manually by going to the Release section of your repo and selecting "Draft a new release".

## Maintenance:
 - To update the server, change the [latest version](https://crates.io/search?q=pankosmia-web) of [panksomia-web](https://docs.rs/pankosmia_web/latest/pankosmia_web/) in `/local_server/Cargo.toml` and re-run the `build_server` script.
 - To sync this repo with its upstream, run the `sync` script.

## Setup, Use, and Maintenance Footnotes
[<b id="f1">1</b>] ...  Windows developers, run <b>.bat</b> scripts from a <b>Powershell or Command terminal</b>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos\pankosmia\[your-desktop-app-repo-name]\windows\scripts>_ `.\[scriptname].bat`<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a **powershell** terminal for the **.ps1** build scripts.
<br />
MacOS developers, run .bsh scripts from a **linux terminal**:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos/pankosmia/[your-desktop-app-repo-name]/linux/scripts>_ `./[scriptname].bsh`
<br />
Linux developers, run .zsh scripts from a **MacOS terminal**:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_...repos/pankosmia/[your-desktop-app-repo-name]/macos/scripts>_ `./[scriptname].zsh`

[<b id="f2">2</b>] ... The build script will fail on any clients set to a different branch with uncommitted changes or with conflicts vs, the latest main pull. Scroll back up in the terminal to find any build errors and address them.

[<b id="f3">3</b>] ... If running into an error saying that another instance is running, you can either find the other instance and stop it, or simply reboot. Another instance could be one started from a .zip, .tgz, installed version, run from a different repo, or a manually started panksomia-web.

## Additional Info TL;DR - For reference when needed!
### Ecosystem setup and configuration
This repo pulls together several libraries and projects into a single app. The projects are spread across several repos to allow modular reuse. Scripts follow for assisting in setup, though it can also all be setup manually. The following assume [the repos](https://github.com/pankosmia/repositories) are installed with the following directory structure.

This is an example. Clients in use may vary. Configuration is handled via `app_config.env`and the `app_setup` script.

<pre>
|-- repos
    |-- pankosmia
        |-- core-client-content repository
        |-- core-client-dashboard repository
        |-- core-client-i18n-editor repository
        |-- core-client-remote-repos repository
        |-- core-client-settings repository
        |-- core-client-workspace repository
        |-- [your-desktop-app-repo-name] <b><em>(30 characters or less on windows!)</em></b>
        |-- resource-core
        |-- webfonts-core
</pre>

### Installing the clients
The local_server (pankosmia_web) serves compiled files from the `build` directory of each client, each client must be built. 

This is handled by the `clone` and `build_clients` scripts, though can also all be run manually which is helpful during development.
```
# In each client repo, NOT this repo!
npm install
npm run build
```
Running `run`, `build_server`, or `bundle_...` all copy the latest build to the build environment.

### Scripts

#### Configuration

Config files must match clients and assets utilized. Scripts that write them are provided, as per `app_config.env`. Files created by the app_setup script are:

| Linux | Windows | MacOS |
|-------|---------|-------|
| <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />/linux/buildResources/setup/app_setup.json</pre> | <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />\windows\buildResources\setup\app_setup.json</pre> | <pre>buildSpec.json<br />/globalBuildResources/i18nPatch.json<br />/macos/buildResources/setup/app_setup.json</pre> 

Review `app_config.env` and adjust as needed, then run one of the setup scripts that follow.  Re-run the app_setup script anytime `app_config.env` is changed.
